##Model To Predict The Stability of  a Power Grid System

 Electrical grids require a balance between electricity supply and demand in order to be stable. Conventional systems achieve this balance through demand-driven electricity production.
 For future grids with a high share of inflexible  (i.e., renewable) energy source, the concept of demand response is a promising solution. This implies changes in electricity consumption in
 relation to electricity price changes. In this work, a binary classification model was built to predict if a grid is stable or unstable using the UCI Electrical Grid Stability Simulated dataset.
 Different classifier models were used and the onethat best suits the main objective(s) of this analysis was specified.

 From the feature Importance chart, it can be seen that reaction time of network 
participants contributes the most to determining if a grid is stable or not.
